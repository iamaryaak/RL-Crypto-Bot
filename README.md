# Using Reinforcement Learning to Trade Cryptocurrencies
This repository contains code to accompany our working paper, "Using Reinforcement Learning to Trade Cryptocurrencies". The work began as a course project at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, under the supervision of Professor Mubbasir Kapadia.

# Setting up
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a console to load up necessary packages.

# Running the RL Bots

# Running the Baseline
Run `python3 macd_bot.py`. The console will list actions taken and final performance; the GUI will graph coin, MACD, signal, and portfolio value over time.
